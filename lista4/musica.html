            <h4>Lyric</h4>
            <p>You've got the devil in your eyes<br>
                You went and took me by surprise<br>
                Say what you wanna say I won't go back<br>
                If you wanna hit the road then let's go then<br>
                Let's just go and see the world and just show them<br>
                What it really means to live life golden<br>
                <br>
                Yeah we're golden, baby girl we're golden<br>
                They about to see us shine 'cause we're golden<br>
                They can never break us down 'cause we're golden<br>
                They about to see us glow 'cause we're golden<br>
                <br>
                Yeah we're golden, baby girl we're golden<br>
                They about to see us shine 'cause we're golden<br>
                They can never break us down 'cause we're golden<br>
                They about to see us glow 'cause we're golden<br>
                <br>
                You've got the devil in your eyes<br>
                You went and took me by surprise<br>
                Say what you wanna say I won't go back<br>
